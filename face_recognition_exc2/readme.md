# Face detection and recognition
## Overview
This jupyter notebook is one artifact of a Computer Vision course in our CS Master's degree. <br>
Based on the lectures about Face Detection & recognition, this task was about face detection and labeling. <br>

## Task definition
The task was to develop a python application that would train on a given dataset (set of face labeled images) and then to be able to run on a matching test set and recognize the faces.

### What's in it?
The face detection is based on opencv Cascade algorithm (viola jones), while the recognition part is based on the eigenfaces algorithm, and implemented by us for the sake of this task.
